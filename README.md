Install the bot using the following steps:

    - This will install any missing dependencies.
    - This assumes you already have node.js installed on your machine.
    - Here is a [link](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install node.js on your machine.
3. In the directory of the forked repository, run the following command: node little_holby.js

    - The installation needs to be done by the server admin or a server moderator.
5. The bot is now ready to take commands on the server.

## Future Updates

More features will be added to the bot including:
- Custom commands for specific roles
- Ticket system to be converted to a database storage instead of a text file
- Welcome/leave messages for users
- Move users in a voice channel
- Playing music in a voice channel
- Create a poll

## Known bugs
- Unmuting a non muted user will crash the bot.
- The Bot will not create a muted role automatically, this needs to be done manually in order for the mute command to work.
