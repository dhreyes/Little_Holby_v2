    - This will start the bot.
4. The bot needs to be linked to a Discord server, which can be found on our [landing page.](http://littleholby.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)
    - The installation needs to be done by the server admin or a server moderator.
5. The bot is now ready to take commands on the server.

## How to use the bot:
The command prefix for the bot is `!`.
The usage of the commands is as follows:
    - `!help`:
        - This will show a list of commands.

        - This will ban the user from the server.

        - This will kick the user from the server.
    - `!mute <@user> <reason>`:
        - This will mute the user from the server.
    - `!unmute <@user> <reason>`:
        - This will unmute the user from the server.
    - `!unban <@user> <reason>`:
        - This will unban the user from the server.
    - `!addrole <@user> <role>`:
        - This will add the role to the user.
    - `!removerole <@user> <role>`:
        - This will remove the role from the user.
    - `!ticket`:
        - This will create a ticket link that can be used to create a private ticket with ticket creator and user.

## Future Updates

More features will be added to the bot including:
- Custom commands for specific roles
- Ticket system to be converted to a database storage instead of a text file
- Welcome/leave messages for users
- Move users in a voice channel
- Playing music in a voice channel
- Create a poll

## Known bugs
- Unmuting a non muted user will crash the bot.
- The Bot will not create a muted role automatically, this needs to be done manually in order for the mute command to work.
